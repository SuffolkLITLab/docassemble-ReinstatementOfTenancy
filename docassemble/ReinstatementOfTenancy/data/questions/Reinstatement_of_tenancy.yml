  This question is used to introduce your interview. Please customize
id: Reinstatement of Tenancy Form
continue button field: Reinstatement_of_tenancy_intro
question: |
  Motion to Dismiss Eviction Case - Reinstatement of Tenancy
subquestion: |
  If your landlord has done something that is not consistent with evicting
  you, such as asking you to sign a new lease, a judge may decide that your
  tenancy has been "reinstated". That means your landlord would lose this
  case and need to file a new one.
  
  This website will help you find out if your landlord has "reinstated"
  your tenancy.
